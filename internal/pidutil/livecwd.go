// LiveState captures the working directories of every live process observed
// on this host, plus whether the enumeration itself succeeded. This backs
// internal/session's working-directory collision guard (ga-ighomh.1
// acceptance criterion 5). cmd/gc's worktree reaper predates this package and
// keeps its own /proc walk (cmd/gc/bead_worktree_liveness.go) because it
// additionally falls back to a portable lsof-based scan
// (bead_worktree_liveness_fallback.go) on hosts without /proc — a fallback
// this package does not yet have. A future change could move that fallback
// here so both callers share one mechanism; until then, both independently
// fail closed the same way (scanned=false) when /proc itself can't be read.

//
// Per-process readlink failures are skipped, not fatal: a process may exit

// cannot resolve. The fleet runs every agent as the same user, so agent
